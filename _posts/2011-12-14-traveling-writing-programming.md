> <p>The peculiar thing about programmers is that they're the one profession that can easily work remotely and travel, and yet they're the one profession that doesn't. Of course there are exceptions, but on my travels I didn't meet another programmer doing anything similar; a sad state of affairs. My message to fellow programmers is stop making excuses, man up and do it. You only live once, and I guarantee that you will have the time of your life.</p>
> <p>As for me, I feel incredibly fortunate to be in the position I'm in, to have found my passion and to be doing what I love every day. That said, much of my current situation is no accident or fluke, but rather the result of planning, goals and work.</p>

> <p>The point of this post isn't some self-aggrandizing narcissistic pontification, but rather to demonstrate that setting goals works, and to inspire people to do likewise. Work out where you are now, where you want to be in a year, and set-down a series of concrete steps that will get you there. Follow your dreams.</p>
